# üå©Ô∏è Introduction to Cloud Computing

This README provides a basic understanding of cloud computing concepts, including types of clouds, their advantages, and a brief overview of AWS (Amazon Web Services).

## üìå What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing refers to the **delivery of computing services over the Internet**. These services include servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more. Instead of owning and maintaining physical data centers or servers, users can access technology services on-demand from a cloud provider.

## üè† What is a Private Cloud?

A **private cloud** is a cloud computing environment dedicated to a single organization. It can be physically located at the organization's on-site data center or hosted by a third-party provider. The key point is that the services and infrastructure are always maintained on a private network and the hardware and software are dedicated solely to that organization.

**Examples:**
- On-premise data centers
- Hosted private clouds (e.g., VMware Cloud)

## üåç What is a Public Cloud?

A **public cloud** is owned and operated by third-party cloud service providers. They deliver their computing resources‚Äîlike servers and storage‚Äîover the Internet. In this model, the cloud provider is responsible for managing the system and its resources.

**Popular Public Cloud Providers:**
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

## ‚öñÔ∏è Public Cloud vs Private Cloud

| Feature            | Public Cloud                     | Private Cloud                     |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Accessibility      | Available to general public      | Restricted to one organization   |
| Cost               | Pay-as-you-go                    | High upfront costs               |
| Maintenance        | Handled by provider              | Handled internally               |
| Scalability        | Highly scalable                  | Limited by internal infrastructure |
| Security           | Varies by provider               | High control and customization   |
